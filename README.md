## BookCars

BookCars is a highly customizable, scalable, and cost-efficient solution for car rental businesses. Its robust feature set and open-source nature make it a sustainable choice for long-term growth in the rental industry.

BookCars is designed for startups looking to launch a single-supplier car rental business, companies that need a multi-supplier rental solution, developers who want to study a full-stack codebase for learning, and anyone looking for a solid foundation to build a custom car rental platform.

It comes with built-in support for [Stripe](https://stripe.com/global) and [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/country-worldwide) payment gateways, allowing you to choose the one best suited for your country or business model. If Stripe isn't available in your region, PayPal serves as a secure and reliable alternative.

You can deploy BookCars with minimal cost using the [Docker-based setup](https://github.com/aelassas/bookcars/wiki/Installing-(Docker)). It runs efficiently on a small virtual server with just 1GB of RAM—ideal for startups and small businesses. Hosting can cost around $5/month using cloud providers like [Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com/cloud/) or [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/pricing/droplets).

BookCars supports both single-supplier and multi-supplier modes. Suppliers can manage their fleets and bookings through a dedicated admin panel. Each new supplier receives an email prompting them to create their account and gain access to the system.

The admin panel allows admins to manage suppliers, cars, countries, locations, parking spots, customers, bookings, and payments.

Customers can register through the web frontend or mobile app, search for available cars based on pickup and drop-off points and time, choose a car and complete the checkout process in a few clicks.
