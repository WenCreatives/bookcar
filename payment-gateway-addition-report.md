# Report: What Needs to Be Done to Add an Additional Payment Gateway

## 1. Overview
The current codebase supports PayPal and Stripe payment gateways. Payment gateway logic is split between controllers, payment service modules, booking integration, and configuration. To add a new payment gateway, the following areas need to be addressed.

## 2. Files and Areas to Modify

- **backend/src/payment/**
  - Create a new payment service module (e.g., `newGateway.ts`) implementing the new gateway's API calls (e.g., create order, get order status).

- **backend/src/controllers/**
  - Create a new controller (e.g., `newGatewayController.ts`) to handle API requests related to the new gateway (e.g., create order, check payment status).

- **backend/src/config/**
  - Add new routes for the new gateway's API endpoints similar to `stripeRoutes.config.ts`.
  - Add environment configuration variables for the new gateway credentials (e.g., API keys, secrets) in `env.config.ts` or equivalent.

- **backend/src/models/Booking.ts**
  - Add new fields if needed to store the new gateway's payment identifiers or status.

- **backend/src/controllers/bookingController.ts**
  - Extend the checkout and payment processing logic to handle the new gateway's payment info and update booking status accordingly.

- **frontend/** and **mobile/**
  - Add UI components and integration to support the new payment gateway's checkout flow and payment status handling.

## 3. Steps to Implement

1. Implement the new payment service module to interact with the new gateway's API.
2. Implement the new controller to expose API endpoints for frontend/mobile to create payments and check status.
3. Add routes and environment config for the new gateway.
4. Extend `bookingController` to process new gateway payment results and update bookings.
5. Update `Booking` model if necessary.
6. Update frontend and mobile apps to integrate the new gateway's payment flow.
7. Add tests covering the new gateway integration in backend and frontend.

## 4. Testing Considerations

- **Backend:** Test new API endpoints, payment processing, booking updates, error handling, and edge cases.
- **Frontend/Mobile:** Test payment UI, checkout flow, error handling, and booking status updates.
- **Integration:** Test end-to-end payment flow from frontend to backend and booking confirmation.

## 5. Summary

Adding a new payment gateway requires coordinated changes across backend services, data models, and frontend/mobile UI. Proper testing is essential to ensure smooth integration and user experience.

Please confirm your preferred level of testing for this new payment gateway integration:
- Critical-path testing (key elements only)
- Thorough testing (complete coverage)

Also, specify if you want testing focused only on the new gateway endpoints and UI or the entire booking and payment flow.
